          <br /> Testing . . . 1 . 2 . . 3
          <br />
          <br /> My name is Kang Te-Oh
          <br /> I was a programmer in the past, working 9-5 day in and
          <br /> day out, with little breaks in between. In 2005, I suddenly
          <br /> woke up inside my computer.
          <br />
          <br /> I don't remember much from the real world, except that I was
          <img src="readme deco 1.png" alt="ReadMe decorations" width="25%" align="left"/>
          <br /> interested in art, music, writing, video games, and programming
          <br /> Maybe that I explains how I got here. Sigh ( – ⌓ – )
          <br />
          <br /> I then entered the internet, and this is where I've lived ever since (kangteoh19@gmail.com, @saltwithglasses in other SMs).
          <br />
          <br /> This is one of the places I found in the internet that's 
          <br /> very familiar to me, so now I consider it home.

        <p>
          <br /> Before, finding corners in the web that felt familiar was near impossible. 
          <br /> Every link led to another, and each page was drastically different from the last. 
          <br /> I keep discovering new things to see and feel the deeper I go.
          <br /> It was so different from how thing look and work these days.
          <br /> I don't hate it though. It's easier to find art, code and games now.
          <br />
          <br /> While wandering the internet 
          <img src="readme deco 2.png" alt="ReadMe decorations" width="25%" align="right"/>
          <br />I learned how to do these things:
            <a href="https://skillicons.dev">

              <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=figma,blender,godot,unreal" />
            </a>
          <br /> Now I'm working on my own games 
          <br />["Truth in Fragments"(VN), "The Hospital Visit"(RPG)]
          <br /> Don't ask me how I'm able to do that 
          <br /> while inside the machine myself ( - ᴗ - )

          <br /> Living in the internet, it felt nice at first. I was far away from the worries that 
          <br /> plagued me in the real world. I could sleep wherever I want, eat whatever I want, 
          <br /> and most importantly, go enjoy my time leisurely for once. 
          <br /> 
          <br /> Every path I took led me farther and farther from my computer, where I came from.

          <br /> But... Almost 19 years of being stuck here, I'm starting to feel its effects on me.
          <br /> Billions of webpages and internet users, and they don't know I exist inside.

          <br /> I want out. I can feel myself melting away. 
          <br /> I was happy, at least I thought I was. But this was still a prison. 
          <br /> I need to get to my computer. I don't know where it is.. 
          <br /> I don't know where I am..
          <br /> There's just so many screens on all at once. But none of them had freed me.
          <br />
          <br /> The ones I've tried have all been broken.
          <br /> The ones I've tried have all been broken.
          <br /> The ones I've tried have all been broken.
          <br /> The ones I've tried have all been. . .
          <br />
          <br /> The ones I've tried have all been fine, but it wasn't the right exit.
          <br /> Maybe the next one would be it.
          <br /> Hey... this screen is on. This computer is on. Is this yours?
