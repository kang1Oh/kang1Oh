          <br /> My name is Kang Te-Oh
          <br /> I was a programmer in the past, working 9-5 day in and
          <br /> day out, with little breaks in between. In 2005, I suddenly
          <br /> woke up inside the internet.
          <br />
          <br /> I don't remember much from the real world, except that I was
          <img src="readme deco 1.png" alt="ReadMe decorations" width="25%" align="left"/>
          <br /> interested in art, music, writing, video games, and programming
          <br /> Maybe that I explains how I got here. Sigh ( – ⌓ – )
          <br />
          <br /> This is one of the places I found on the internet that's 
          <br /> very familiar to me, so now I consider it home.
